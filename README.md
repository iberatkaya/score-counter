<h1 align="center">Welcome to Score Counter 👋</h1>

Score Counter is an Apple Watch App developed with Swift and SwiftUI. It lets users track the score of games with two players/teams such as soccer or basketball. This is my first SwiftUI project and it is available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1540365945)!
